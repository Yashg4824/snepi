Developed Portal for “Drought Monitoring for Jal Surakhsha Portal IIT D"

About Snepi Index : https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AGUFM.H32I..06S/abstract

This Index is use for Drought Monitor, this project is part of Research Going in IIT Under Prof Dhanya C T, Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Delhi & Phd Research Scholar Gauranshi Raj.

My project, "DROUGHT MONITOR," aims to introduce a real-time drought detection system in India. My role was to create a portal that integrates the Drought Index (Matlab Code). This project will soon be part of a larger initiative.

Throughout the internship, we faced setbacks that required us to change our approach multiple times. I learned to use Google Earth Engine, WebGis, Matlab, Precipitation Data, Potential Evapotranspiration Data, and the SPEI Index. With determination and invaluable support from my mentor, I persevered and successfully completed the project.

My Role: It was to understand the snepi index and deliver a site similar to US DROUGHT MONITOR which displays Drough in real time using Snepi Index
